			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

			// and we want to make a copy of it.
			//const team = players;
			//so instead of directly referencing we can use slice to copy the original array
			// it will fix the referencing problem
			// You might think we can just do something like this:
			//console.log(team);
			// however what happens when we update that array?
			// now here is the problem!
			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
			// one way
			//const team = players.slice();

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in
			//const team = [].concat(players);

			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const team = [...players];
			team[3] = "Prince";
			//console.log(team);
			//console.log(players);
			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: "Wes Bos",
				age: 80,
			};

			// and think we make a copy:
			const captain = person;
			//captain.age = 99;

			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
			//console.log(cap2);
			//console.log(person);
			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
			const cap3 = { ...person };
			console.log(cap3);
